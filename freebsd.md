### FreeBSD
Forked from the Net/2 & 386BSD code base, 6 months after NetBSD was started.
The focus of FreeBSD was performance on i386 systems. Over time support was
added for the DEC Alpha as this meant porting the code base to a 64bit systems
and addressing any bugs which would prevent the code base from running on a
64bit system. Many years later the project branched out and introduced support
for additional platforms. Today the project boasts support for CPUs such as
ARMv8, [RISC-V](http://riscv.org/) and
[BERI](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/beri/).
