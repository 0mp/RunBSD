* Try to keep feature coverage high level rather than dig into implemention
details.
* Try to cover only unique features on OS specific pages and commonly shared
features in common.md.
* Try to avoid highlighting missing functionality in shared components, instead 
describe the difference of approach to those shared components.
* Be excellent to each other!
