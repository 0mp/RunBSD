### OpenBSD
Forked from NetBSD, the focus of OpenBSD is security. The project is home to many components which see wider use outside of OpenBSD, such as OpenSSH, PF (firewall), LibreSSL and [others](http://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html).

OpenBSD was forked from NetBSD 1.0 - the source code was made publicly available on 18 October 1995 via anonymous CVS.  The first release was OpenBSD 1.2 which was released in July 1996, with a second release of OpenBSD 2.0 in October 1996.  OpenBSD has six monthly releases, usually in the April and October each year, with releases supported for one year.
